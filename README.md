# Landing-Page
My first landing page creation courteous of The Odin Project

This is going to be a huge undertaking for me so far in my web development journey. I have been
working through The Odin Project for the last two months and feel that my base knowledge of HTML and
CSS has already gotten so much better. I have worked through the exercises and assignments in order
so far. I feel fairly confident in my abilities as of now and this landing page project will be a 
good test for me. Looking forward to see how it turns out and to keep progressing in my journey to
become a full-time web developer!
